    "   Equation :  y = x\n",
    "   Uses : Linear activation function is used at just one place i.e. output layer.\n",
    "    For example : Calculation of price of a house is a regression problem. House price may have any big/small value, so we can apply linear activation at output layer. Even in this case neural net must have any non-linear function at hidden layers. \n",

    "Sigmoid Functio:\n",
    "    Equation : A = 1/(1 + e^-x)\n",
    "    Uses : Usually used in output layer of a binary classification, where result is either 0 or 1, as value for sigmoid function lies between 0 and 1 only so, result can be predicted easily to be 1 if value is greater than 0.5 and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "    Uses :- Usually used in hidden layers of a neural network as it’s values lies between -1 to 1 hence the mean for the hidden layer comes out be 0 or very close to it, hence helps in centering the data by bringing mean close to 0. This makes learning for the next layer much easier.\n",

    "     Uses :- ReLu is less computationally expensive than tanh and sigmoid because it involves simpler mathematical operations. At a time only a few neurons are activated making the network sparse making it efficient and easy for computation.\n",
    "\n",
    " d. Softmax Function : \n",
    "     Uses :- Usually used when trying to handle multiple classes. the softmax function was commonly found in the output layer of image classification problems.The softmax function would squeeze the outputs for each class between 0 and 1 and would also divide by the sum of the outputs. "
